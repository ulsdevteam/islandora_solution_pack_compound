SUMMARY
-------

The Islandora Compound Object Solution Pack enables generic parent-child relationships between objects. The object view

Navigation" block provides a thumbnail navigation of an object's siblings. A "Compound" management tab allows for the
addition and removal of parent and child objects for each object.
